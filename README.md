This project is a mini solo project I'm working on

YouTube Py Downloader (name not final) is a GUI YouTube video downloader that is intended 
to be used as a free alternative to other downloaders that require payment.

This project makes use of the pytube library (https://pypi.org/project/pytube/) for
downloading the YouTube videos and the TKinter module for GUI.

This project is NOT finished and updates will not be regular, many features that are listed within
the program do not have any function yet, I am simply uploading this to showcase the progress I make.
